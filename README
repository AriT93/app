This app is just where I am trying to put together everything I'm learning about
sinatra and ruby into a choherent format.

Currently I have integrated Sinatra RSpec Cucumber and DataMapper  I also have a
start on a rake file.

I have used DataMapper Migrations to provide for a rails-like migration setup

I have started on some rudimentary cucumber and Rspec tests.  I will continue on
with these as I come up with things for the "App" app to do.

input is welcome if you have stumbled across this project
